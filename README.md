# Adelya's Website Portfolio

Welcome to Adelya's (experimental) website portfolio. This website is a practice in using React.js (even though all she knows is how to separate everything into its components, but hey, at least there's a touch of React in it, right? *sigh*).

The website is definitely a work in progress as she continues to dig into more web stacks. But so far, she's quite proud of the card-tilting transition (please hover over it with your mouse, or just click-click around the card—because, probably by the time you read this, she's still playing with the card, *sigh again*).

Also, she’s not a fan of the continuous typewriter effect, so it's only used once. To see the typewriter effect, please refresh the page (why does a README description have to tell anyone to do this and that? I swear I'll do better next time in making my website implicitly tell people what to do!).

### Stack Used

- **React.js**: Helping to break down the website into components (not to mention the help of useState (the only thing I know right now, *another sigh*)
- **Vite.js**: Just to make the builds faster.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To style the website (I'm quite afraid of pure CSS, honestly. *last sigh*).
